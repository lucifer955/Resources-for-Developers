## Frameworks

### Frontend Frameworks

| Website | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|[Angular](https://angular.io/)	| AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community |
|[VueJs](https://v3.vuejs.org/) | VueJs is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. It is perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications |
|[React](https://reactjs.org/) | ReactJS is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components |
|[Ember](https://emberjs.com//) | Ember.js is a productive, battle-tested JavaScript framework for building modern web applications. It includes everything you need to build rich UIs that work on any device. |
|[Backbone.js](https://backbonejs.org/) | Backbone is a JavaScript framework based on MVC architecture for building single page applications |
|[Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/) | Aurelia's standards-based, unobtrusive style makes it the only framework that empowers you to build components using vanilla JavaScript or TypeScript. If you know modern JS and HTML, there's little more to learn to build even the most complex apps. |
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)	| Svelte is a radical new approach to designing user interfaces. Whereas conventional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte transfers the work to a compile phase the happens when you create your app. Instead of using strategies such as virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes. |
|[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) | Preact offers the finest possible abstraction of Virtual DOM at the top of the DOM. Builds on stable platform functionality, registers real event handlers, and plays nicely with other libraries. Preact can be used directly in the browser without any transpiring steps. |
|[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) |  Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed. |
